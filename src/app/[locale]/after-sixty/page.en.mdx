# After sixty

Concept:

The project develops a psychological model of life that is conditionally based on dividing human existence into three conditional ages:

0–16 years — the formation of the body, health, basic education, and identity.

17–60 years — the realization of life roles: family, profession, love, social connections, talent, economic activity.

60+ years — a life cycle oriented not toward external roles, but toward the awareness of the source and the reintegration of what has been acquired into the Self, with full restoration of health and work capacity, awareness, and the free realization of one’s future.

Problem:

Modern society does not offer a stable, constructive life model for a person after 60. The retirement age is associated with a decline in strength, withdrawal from social life, and the loss of identity. Meanwhile, the enormous potential of mature age — experience, inner volume, the capacity for contemplation and wisdom — is cut off by death.

Startup Goal:

To create a scientific–psychological concept of “Holiness” as a way of life after 60 years, alongside the administration of ancestral death, which today remains the only existing perspective.

What the project offers:

An educational, therapeutic, and social space for mastering the way of life after sixty.

Tools for transferring meaning: from external structures (family, work, status) to the Self as the source of family, work, and status.

A model of social integration in which 60+ is the beginning of a new life cycle, not the completion of the previous one.

Mission:

To create a model of life after 60, a concept of holiness aimed at organizing favorable conditions for the realization of the Self as the source of health and talent; to transfer meaning to the source so as to replace the ancestral life resource given to us by our parents at birth; and to establish in society a stable way of life after the conditional age of sixty, with full restoration of health and work capacity.
