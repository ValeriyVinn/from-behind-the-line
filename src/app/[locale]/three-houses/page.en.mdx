# Memory Lab “Three Houses”

“Three Houses Memory Lab” is a psychological platform that explores and trains the mechanisms of memory formation and destruction through the model of three Houses:

1. The body is an innervated house, part of the Genus, in which the Person is the main owner with the first right to form memory and which forms memory through key events (the process of birth, intimacy, sports, work, marriage, abortion, trauma, death, gradual acquisition and transfer of ownership/co-ownership).

2. Real estate/housing is a non-innervated house for the Genus body, which forms memory through the actions of the owner/co-owner (construction, purchase, rental, sale, co-habitation of memory).

3. Nature is a great source/house that forms memory by the reality of its existence.

Each owner/co-owner can, according to memory mechanisms, access the house, form and destroy the memory of the house, accumulate and transfer memory, become aware of and abandon the process.
